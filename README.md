## Introduction

I have played with MNIST dataset using Tensowflow, Keras, sequential model, Nueral Network with few dense layers.   

## Get and split the Data

[Many ML libraries](#loading-data-with-other-machine-learning-libraries) already include Fashion-MNIST data/API, give it a try!

You can use direct links to download the dataset. The data is stored in the **same** format as the original [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Model Type

- **Sequential Model** - Sequential Model.
- **Functional Model** - Functional Model.
